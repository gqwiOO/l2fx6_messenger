Its my first project on GIT so i made it public because i hope that someone can help me with my future errors.
Im only 17 so i dont know a lot about programming, if you wanna help me with something here is my social:
  ig: @so_hopeless
  telegram: @l2fx6
  discord: lf2x6

My idea is to create messanger(just for myself or not) in which you can message to each other, add friends and maybe something else.
I want to create site for this project{now its working on django API yet maybe in future will be changed on ASP.NET) and desktop app(isnt started yet but it should be writted on C# or Python)
